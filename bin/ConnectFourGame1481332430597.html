		<h3>Blocker Feature Instructions</h3>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>To select the blocker, when it is your turn, select the cooresponding button under Blockers Left.</li>
				<li>Once a blocker is selected, you may play the blocker piece in any available space on the board and the piece will not drop as normal game pieces do.</li>
				<li>The blocker piece can only be played defensively, which means your blocker piece does not count the four piece sequence required to win the game.</li>
				<li>If you look in the top right of the applet, you'll notice the number under blocker life. Once the blocker is selected, you will see that your blocker only lasts for two full turns.</li>
				<li>Once the blocker's life expires, the piece will disappear on the board. Once this happens, the pieces placed above it will drop down and the game will check to see if the pieces played have completed a sequence.</li>
				<li>If more than one piece above the blocker completes a sequence, the player whose piece was placed on the blocker last will count.</li>
				<li>You can only have one of your blockers on the board at once.</li>
				<li>Good luck!</li>
